# Starter Theme Development
---

This is a bare-bones template designed for maximum flexibility in development. Essentially it streamlines the set-up process so you can start with a fresh install of WordPress with all the things you usually add already there. 

#### Begin by adding the follwing plugins with Gulp.

- [Gulp Install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-install) - *`npm install gulp-install --save-dev`*

- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) - *`npm install gulp-sass --save-dev`*

- [MQ-Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-sass) - *`npm install mq-sass --save-dev`*

- [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) - *`npm install gulp-autoprefixer --save-dev`*

- [Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) - *`npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev`*

- [Sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) - *`npm install gulp-sourcemaps --save-dev`*

- [Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel) - *`npm install --save-dev gulp-babel babel-core babel-preset-env`*

- [Concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat) - *`npm install gulp-concat --save-dev`*

- [Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify) -  *`npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev`*
      
- [Rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename) - *`npm install gulp-rename --save-dev`*

#### Initialising the project 

* The set-up is pretty much run through Gulp. This also includes Composer which includes security plugins which are vital to a safe WordPress site. 

* Once you have installed the plugins listed above, you are good to go! 

* In the root directory, simply hit the command `gulp` and everything will automatically set up for you.
